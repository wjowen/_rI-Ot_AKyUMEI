          <h3>About Wyatt Owen</h3>
          <p>I am Wyatt Owen. I am currently a freshmen at the Univeristy of Alaska, Fairbanks pursuing my Bachelor of
            Science in Computer Science. I believe in the future of technology our society is pursuing, we need as many
            people in the technological fields as possible to keep the pillars of Privacy, Authentication, Security, and
            Transparency in balance. With good intentions and foresight, the Computer Scientist of today, can be the
            light for society tomorrow.</p>
          <p>I joined the military in 2014, graduated the 25B Information Technology Specialist course in 2015. After
            Graduating Airborne school a month later, I spent the three years in 4th BCT 25th ID (Airborne) in Fort
            Richardson, Alaska, and some time deployed.</p>
